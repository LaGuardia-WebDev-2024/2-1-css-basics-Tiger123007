    <h1>The coolest creature</h1>
  <p>The <em>Tiger</em> is awesome because <strong>it is powerful, beautiful, an excellent hunter, and has striking orange and black stripes. Tigers are also the largest wild cats in the world and are known for their strength and agility.</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Tigers like to be alone, and they are great at swimming. They can jump really far and see well at night. Tigers talk to each other by making sounds and leaving smells. There are not many tigers left, so people are trying to help them survive.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Tigers have striped skin as well as striped fur! Each tiger's stripe pattern is unique, just like human fingerprints.</p>
    <p><strong>Another fun fact:</strong> White tigers are just regular tigers with white fur. They are very rare and look cool in the snow.</p>
